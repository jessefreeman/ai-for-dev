# Evaluation

Learn how to properly test and evaluate different LLMs for your specific use cases. This section covers benchmarking methodologies, performance metrics, and practical evaluation techniques to help you choose the right model for your development needs.

## What You'll Learn

- How to systematically test and compare different LLMs
- Key performance metrics that matter for coding tasks
- Standardized evaluation procedures for consistent results
- Creating custom tests for your specific use cases
- Interpreting benchmark results and making informed decisions

## Section Overview

| Topic                   | Description                                         | Difficulty   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Testing Each Model      | Systematic approach to evaluating individual models | Beginner     |
| Standardized Evaluation | Using consistent benchmarks for fair comparisons    | Intermediate |

## Evaluation Criteria

### Performance Metrics

- **Code Quality**: Accuracy, syntax correctness, and best practices adherence
- **Response Speed**: Time to first token and sustained generation rate
- **Context Understanding**: Ability to maintain context in long conversations
- **Language Support**: Coverage of different programming languages
- **Resource Efficiency**: Memory usage and computational requirements

### Practical Considerations

- **Installation Ease**: How simple is it to set up and configure
- **Stability**: Reliability during extended use sessions
- **Model Availability**: Ease of downloading and updating models
- **Documentation Quality**: Support resources and community

## Testing Methodology

### Standardized Tests

We provide standardized coding tasks that help you compare models fairly:

- Code generation from natural language descriptions
- Code explanation and documentation
- Bug detection and fixing
- Code refactoring and optimization
- Multi-language code translation

### Custom Evaluation

Learn to create tests specific to your workflow:

- Testing with your actual codebase
- Domain-specific coding challenges
- Integration with your development tools
- Team-specific coding standards

## Making the Right Choice

Evaluation isn't just about finding the "best" modelâ€”it's about finding the best model **for your needs**:

- **Beginners**: Focus on ease of use and clear explanations
- **Experienced Developers**: Prioritize code quality and advanced features
- **Teams**: Consider consistency and collaboration features
- **Resource-Constrained**: Balance performance with hardware requirements
