# MacBook Pro M3 Max + 30-Core GPU Performance Overview

The MacBook Pro M3 Max, equipped with 36 GB of RAM, a 14-core CPU, and a 30-core GPU, excels in AI tasks such as Style Transfer, Pose Estimation, and Object Detection. This system is designed for intensive parallel processing, delivering strong performance across both its GPU and Apple’s Neural Engine. While its raw GPU performance may not match that of NVIDIA's 40-series GPUs, the MacBook Pro offers unique advantages with its **unified memory architecture**, allowing the CPU and GPU to share memory dynamically. This enables the loading and processing of larger AI models that might be constrained by the fixed VRAM of discrete GPUs like those from NVIDIA.

#### Hardware Specs:

- **CPU**: Apple M3 Max (14-core CPU)
- **GPU**: 30-core GPU
- **RAM**: 36 GB Unified Memory
- **Display**: 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR

**Estimated Total Price (2024)**: $2,999

This reflects the current price of the system as of 2024.

#### Price-to-Performance: 445.88 IPS per $100

The MacBook Pro M3 Max achieves a price-to-performance ratio of 445.88 IPS per $100, based on its overall single precision GPU benchmark score of 13,358.
