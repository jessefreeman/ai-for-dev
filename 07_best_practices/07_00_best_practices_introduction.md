# Best Practices

Discover proven strategies and best practices for running LLMs locally. This section covers optimization techniques, workflow integration, performance tuning, and common pitfalls to avoid when working with local AI models for development.

## What You'll Learn

- Proven workflows for integrating LLMs into your development process
- Performance optimization techniques for different hardware configurations
- Security considerations when running models locally
- Memory management and resource optimization strategies
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them

## Core Principles

### 1. **Right Model for the Right Task**

- Match model capabilities to your specific needs
- Don't use a 30B model for simple autocomplete tasks
- Consider speed vs. quality trade-offs

### 2. **Resource Management**

- Monitor memory usage and prevent system overload
- Implement proper model loading/unloading strategies
- Balance background processes with LLM performance

### 3. **Workflow Integration**

- Start small and gradually increase LLM usage
- Establish clear use cases and success criteria
- Train team members on effective prompt techniques

### 4. **Performance Optimization**

- Regular model updates and maintenance
- Hardware-specific optimization techniques
- Monitoring and alerting for performance issues

## Best Practice Categories

| Category                  | Focus Area                            | Impact |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Setup & Configuration** | Initial installation and optimization | High   |
| **Daily Workflow**        | Integrating LLMs into coding routines | High   |
| **Resource Management**   | Memory, CPU, and GPU optimization     | Medium |
| **Security & Privacy**    | Protecting code and data              | High   |
| **Team Collaboration**    | Sharing models and configurations     | Medium |
| **Maintenance**           | Keeping systems updated and optimized | Medium |

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Over-reliance**: Using LLMs for tasks better done manually
- **Under-utilization**: Not leveraging LLM capabilities fully
- **Poor prompting**: Ineffective communication with models
- **Resource waste**: Running oversized models unnecessarily
- **Security gaps**: Exposing sensitive code or data

## Success Metrics

Track your LLM integration success with these metrics:

- **Development Speed**: Time saved on coding tasks
- **Code Quality**: Improvement in code reviews and bug rates
- **Learning Acceleration**: Faster adoption of new technologies
- **Team Satisfaction**: Developer experience improvements
