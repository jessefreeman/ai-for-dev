# The Models I Actually Use for TypeScript/JavaScript

After testing dozens of coding models over the past year, here's my real-world comparison based on daily TypeScript and JavaScript development. This isn't about benchmarks - it's about which models actually help me write better code faster.

## My Current Setup

I use different models for different coding tasks. Here's what works in practice:

**Primary Model**: DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct (daily driver)
**Complex TypeScript**: Qwen2.5-Coder 7B or DeepSeek 33B
**Quick JS Questions**: Mistral 7B
**Learning New Frameworks**: DeepSeek models

## TypeScript/JavaScript Performance Rankings

Based on months of real development work, not artificial benchmarks:

### Tier 1: Daily Drivers

| Model                   | Size | TypeScript  | React/Next.js | Node.js   | Memory | My Rating |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ------ | --------- |
| **DeepSeek Coder 6.7B** | 6.7B | Excellent   | Very Good     | Good      | 4GB    | 9/10      |
| **Qwen2.5-Coder 7B**    | 7B   | Excellent   | Very Good     | Good      | 4GB    | 8.5/10    |
| **DeepSeek Coder 33B**  | 33B  | Outstanding | Excellent     | Excellent | 20GB   | 9.5/10    |

### Tier 2: Solid Options

| Model                 | Size | TypeScript  | React/Next.js | Node.js   | Memory | My Rating |
| --------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ------ | --------- |
| **Mistral 7B**        | 7B   | Good        | Good          | Very Good | 4GB    | 7.5/10    |
| **Qwen2.5-Coder 32B** | 32B  | Outstanding | Excellent     | Excellent | 20GB   | 9/10      |

### Tier 3: Limited Use Cases

| Model               | Size | TypeScript | React/Next.js | Node.js | Memory | My Rating |
| ------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ------ | --------- |
| **Phi-3 Mini 3.8B** | 3.8B | Fair       | Fair          | Good    | 2GB    | 6/10      |

## What Each Model Is Actually Good At

### DeepSeek Coder 6.7B - My Daily Driver

**What it excels at**:

- Writing clean TypeScript interfaces and types
- React component patterns and hooks
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+, async/await)
- API integration and JSON handling

**Real examples where it shines**:

- Generating TypeScript types from JSON schemas
- Creating proper React component structures
- Writing Node.js API endpoints with correct typing

### Qwen2.5-Coder - For Complex TypeScript

**What it excels at**:

- Advanced TypeScript features (conditional types, mapped types)
- Complex generic type manipulations
- Large-scale TypeScript architecture decisions

**When I use it**:

- Building complex type systems
- Refactoring large TypeScript codebases
- Working with advanced TypeScript patterns

### Mistral 7B - The Quick Helper

**What it excels at**:

- Fast responses for simple questions
- Basic JavaScript patterns
- Explaining code and debugging

**When I use it**:

- Quick syntax questions
- Simple script generation
- Code explanations and documentation

## Hardware-Based Recommendations

### 8GB VRAM or Less

**Primary Choice**: DeepSeek Coder 6.7B

- Runs smoothly on 4GB VRAM
- Best TypeScript quality in this range
- Fast enough for real-time coding assistance

**Backup Option**: Mistral 7B

- Also 4GB VRAM
- Good for quick questions
- Faster responses but lower TypeScript quality

### 16GB VRAM

**Upgrade to**: StarCoder2 15B or keep DeepSeek 6.7B

- StarCoder2 is good but not significantly better than DeepSeek
- I usually stick with DeepSeek 6.7B for speed

### 20GB+ VRAM

**Go for**: DeepSeek Coder 33B or Qwen2.5-Coder 32B

- Significant quality improvement over smaller models
- Worth the extra resources for complex projects
- DeepSeek 33B is my preference

## Real-World Use Cases

### Building a React App

**Best Model**: DeepSeek Coder 6.7B

- Understands React patterns
- Good with TypeScript props and state
- Handles modern React features (hooks, context, suspense)

### TypeScript Library Development

**Best Model**: Qwen2.5-Coder 7B or DeepSeek 33B

- Better with complex type definitions
- Good architectural decisions
- Understands publishing and packaging

### Node.js API Development

**Best Model**: DeepSeek Coder (any size)

- Solid Express/Fastify patterns
- Good with TypeScript decorators
- Understands async patterns well

### Learning New Framework

**Best Model**: DeepSeek Coder models

- Good at explaining concepts
- Provides working examples
- Understands modern JavaScript ecosystem

## Speed vs Quality Trade-offs

**For Real-time Assistance**: Mistral 7B or DeepSeek 6.7B
**For High-Quality Code**: DeepSeek 33B or Qwen2.5-Coder 32B
**Best Balance**: DeepSeek Coder 6.7B

## Models I Don't Recommend for TypeScript/JS

**Code Llama**: Dated JavaScript patterns, poor TypeScript understanding
**Phi-3 Mini**: Too limited for serious TypeScript work
**StarCoder (original)**: Superseded by newer models
**General models without coding focus**: Inconsistent code quality

## My Setup Evolution

**Started with**: Code Llama 7B (disappointing for TypeScript)
**Moved to**: DeepSeek Coder 6.7B (game changer)
**Added**: Qwen2.5-Coder 7B for complex tasks
**Current**: DeepSeek 6.7B primary, DeepSeek 33B for complex projects

The key insight: model size matters less than training quality for TypeScript/JavaScript. A well-trained 6.7B model beats a poorly-trained 34B model every time.

**Best choices:**

1. **Code Llama Python 34B**: If you have the resources
2. **DeepSeek Coder Instruct 6.7B**: Excellent Python performance
3. **Qwen2.5-Coder 7B**: Strong Python with multi-language support

### For Multi-Language Projects

**Recommended:**

1. **StarCoder2 15B**: Built for multi-language scenarios
2. **Qwen2.5-Coder**: Excellent multi-language support
3. **Code Llama Base**: Solid general programming support

### For Enterprise Use

**Production-ready options:**

1. **Granite Code**: IBM's enterprise-focused model
2. **DeepSeek Coder 33B**: High quality, stable performance
3. **Mistral Small 22B**: Commercial-friendly licensing

### For Research and Experimentation

**Open and flexible:**

1. **OpenCoder**: Transparent training and open weights
2. **StarCoder2**: BigCode project, community-driven
3. **Code Llama**: Meta's open model family
