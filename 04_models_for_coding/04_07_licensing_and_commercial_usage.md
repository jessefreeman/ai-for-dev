# Model Licensing and Commercial Usage Guide

Understanding the licensing terms of AI models is crucial for developers and organizations planning to use local LLMs in their projects. This guide provides detailed information about licensing, commercial usage rights, and compliance considerations.

## Why Licensing Matters

When deploying AI models in production environments, licensing determines:

- **Commercial usage rights**: Whether you can use the model in commercial products
- **Distribution requirements**: How you can share or redistribute the model
- **Attribution obligations**: Whether you need to credit the model creators
- **Liability and warranties**: Legal protections and responsibilities
- **Modification rights**: Whether you can fine-tune or modify the model

## Compliance Best Practices

### Legal Compliance Steps

1. **Read the Full License**

   - Don't rely on summaries
   - Understand all terms and conditions
   - Note any restrictions or requirements

2. **Document Usage**

   - Keep records of which models you use
   - Track license versions and dates
   - Maintain compliance documentation

3. **Include Required Notices**

   - Add license files to your distributions
   - Include copyright notices where required
   - Attribute model creators appropriately

4. **Regular License Review**
   - Check for license updates
   - Review compliance annually
   - Update documentation as needed

### Technical Compliance

1. **Model Distribution**

   ```
   project/
   ├── models/
   │   ├── model_files/
   │   ├── LICENSE.txt          # Model license
   │   └── ATTRIBUTION.md       # Model credits
   ├── src/
   └── LICENSE                  # Your project license
   ```

2. **Code Attribution**

   ```python
   # Example attribution in code
   """
   This application uses Mistral 7B model
   Licensed under Apache 2.0
   Copyright (c) Mistral AI

   Model: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1
   License: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
   """
   ```

3. **API Service Attribution**
   ```json
   {
     "model_info": {
       "name": "Mistral-7B-Instruct",
       "license": "Apache-2.0",
       "source": "https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2",
       "attribution": "Powered by Mistral AI"
     }
   }
   ```

## Enterprise Considerations

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Models (Apache 2.0/MIT):**

- Mistral family
- Phi-3 family
- Qwen2.5-Coder
- Yi-Coder
- Granite Code

**Medium Risk Models (Custom Open Source):**

- StarCoder2 (responsible use requirements)
- DeepSeek Coder (verify terms)

**Higher Risk Models (Restrictive Custom):**

- Code Llama (size-based restrictions)

### Legal Review Checklist

- [ ] Have legal team review license terms
- [ ] Assess compliance with company policies
- [ ] Evaluate potential liability exposure
- [ ] Determine attribution requirements
- [ ] Plan for license change scenarios
- [ ] Document approved models for teams

### Vendor Management

For enterprise deployments, consider:

1. **Commercial Support**: Some vendors offer commercial licenses with support
2. **Indemnification**: Protection against IP claims
3. **Service Level Agreements**: Guaranteed uptime and performance
4. **Compliance Assistance**: Help with licensing requirements

---

## Model Fine-Tuning and Licensing

### Derivative Works

When fine-tuning models, consider:

1. **Original License Terms**: Fine-tuned models inherit base model licensing
2. **Training Data Licensing**: Ensure your training data is appropriately licensed
3. **Distribution Rights**: Understand if you can share fine-tuned models
4. **Commercial Use**: Check if fine-tuning affects commercial usage rights

### Best Practices for Fine-Tuning

```python
# Example: Documenting fine-tuned model licensing
"""
Fine-tuned Model Information:
Base Model: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
Base License: Apache 2.0
Fine-tuning Data: [Describe your dataset and its licensing]
Fine-tuning Method: LoRA
Date: 2025-07-20
Restrictions: Inherits Apache 2.0 terms from base model
"""
```

## License Change Scenarios

### What to Watch For

1. **Model Updates**: New versions may have different licenses
2. **Acquisition Changes**: Company acquisitions can affect licensing
3. **Policy Updates**: Platforms may change usage policies
4. **Regulatory Changes**: Government regulations may affect terms

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Version Pinning**: Lock to specific model versions with known licenses
2. **License Monitoring**: Set up alerts for license changes
3. **Backup Plans**: Identify alternative models with suitable licensing
4. **Regular Audits**: Quarterly review of all model licenses in use

)

for model in "${MODELS[@]}"; do
  echo "Checking license for $model"
  curl -s "https://huggingface.co/$model/raw/main/LICENSE" | md5sum
done
```
