# CodeLlama Instruct Variations

Now let’s look at a couple of variations of the CodeLlama Instrcut model. These range from low memory and fast speed to very high memory and slower speed. Since there are so many variations, let’s just focus on a couple of the most common ones. I find it helps to see these laid out in order of easiest to run to most demanding.

Here's a table to help understand these variations:

| **Model Variation**       | **Memory Usage** | **Resources Required** | **Speed** | **Notes**                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q2_K   | Low              | Low                    | Fast      | Lower precision, suitable for less resource-intensive environments, faster loading times but less accurate. |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q3_K_S | Moderate         | Moderate               | Moderate  | Balanced performance, suitable for environments with moderate resources, better accuracy than Q2. |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q3_K_M | Moderate-High    | Moderate-High          | Moderate  | Balanced performance and precision, suitable for more demanding coding tasks, better accuracy than Q3_K_S. |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q3_K_L | High             | High                   | Moderate  | Higher precision and performance, suitable for environments with more resources, best accuracy among Q3 variants. |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q4_K   | High             | High                   | Slower    | Higher precision and performance, suitable for environments with significant resources, best accuracy but requires more memory and resources. |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q4_K_S | Moderate-High    | Moderate-High          | Moderate  | Good balance of performance and resource usage, slightly lower precision than Q4_K_M but faster. |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q4_K_M | High             | High                   | Moderate  | Excellent balance of precision and performance. Best suited for advanced coding tasks with high resource availability. |
| CodeLlama Instruct Q5_K_M | Very High        | Very High              | Slowest   | Best precision and performance. Suitable for environments with maximum resources and the most demanding coding tasks. |

Given that we aim for comprehensive code generation rather than just quick code completion, it's essential to test different models to find the one that best fits our requirements. The following sections will explore three specific CodeLlama Instruct models, each chosen to represent different performance levels: fastest performance, balanced performance, and maximum performance.

**Fastest Performance**

The first model to consider is codellama-13b-instruct.Q3_K_S.gguf. This model is designed to provide balanced performance while maintaining low resource usage. With a memory usage of 5.66 GB, it operates efficiently, making it suitable for scenarios where you need quick responses without significant delays.

| **Parameter**      | **Value** |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| Memory Usage       | 5.66 GB   |
| Resources Required | Low       |
| Speed              | Fast      |
| Precision          | Moderate  |

By choosing this model, you benefit from the Q3_K_S quantization, which ensures the model remains efficient and responsive. While the precision is moderate, it is adequate for many coding tasks where speed is a priority. This makes it an excellent option for quick iterative tasks or when you need fast feedback from the LLM.

**Balanced Performance**

For a mix of speed and accuracy, the codellama-13b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf model offers a compelling choice. This model strikes a balance between performance and precision, making it suitable for most coding tasks where both are important. With a memory usage of 7.87 GB, it leverages your MacBook’s resources effectively to provide high precision while maintaining good performance.

| **Parameter**      | **Value** |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| Memory Usage       | 7.87 GB   |
| Resources Required | High      |
| Speed              | Moderate  |
| Precision          | High      |

The Q4_K_M quantization ensures higher precision compared to the previous model, making it ideal for more detailed and complex tasks. This model allows you to perform tasks that require a greater level of detail without sacrificing too much speed. It's a versatile option that fits well for general-purpose coding and more involved development work.

**Maximum Performance**

If your priority is the highest possible precision and you are willing to accept longer processing times, then codellama-34b-instruct.Q5_K_M.gguf is the model to test. This model maximizes precision and performance, making it ideal for the most demanding coding tasks where accuracy is paramount. With a memory usage of 20.22 GB, it utilizes the extensive resources of your MacBook Pro M3 Max to deliver detailed and comprehensive outputs.

| **Parameter**      | **Value** |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| Memory Usage       | 20.22 GB  |
| Resources Required | Very High |
| Speed              | Slowest   |
| Precision          | Highest   |

The Q5_K_M quantization ensures the highest level of detail and accuracy, making it suitable for complex problem-solving and generating highly precise code. Although this model may have slower response times, the trade-off in accuracy and performance is significant. This makes it the best choice for critical tasks where precision cannot be compromised.
