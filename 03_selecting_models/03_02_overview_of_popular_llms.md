# Overview of Popular LLMs

In addition to CodeLlama Instruct, there are several other variations of the CodeLlama model, each tailored to specific coding needs. These models differ in their memory usage, resource requirements, and speed, making them suitable for various tasks and environments. Below is a table highlighting these notable variations and their distinct advantages:

| **Model Variation**   | **Memory Usage** | **Resources Required** | **Speed** | **Notes**                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CodeLlama Completion  | Moderate         | Moderate               | Fast      | Optimized for auto-completing code snippets. Ideal for enhancing IDE auto-complete functionality. |
| CodeLlama Instruct    | Moderate         | Moderate               | Moderate  | Best for generating code from high-level descriptions or problem statements. Balances resource usage and accuracy. |
| CodeLlama WizardCoder | High             | High                   | Slow      | Suitable for complex coding tasks requiring sophisticated algorithms. Provides superior performance but needs significant resources. |
| Starcoder             | Moderate-High    | Moderate-High          | Moderate  | Versatile model optimized for multiple programming languages. Suitable for diverse coding scenarios. |
| Cohere Command R      | Moderate         | Moderate               | Moderate  | General-purpose model capable of handling a broad range of tasks, including coding. Ideal for multi-functional environments. |

Selecting the right variation of CodeLlama depends on your specific needs and the nature of your coding tasks. For instance, if you need a model that enhances code completion in an integrated development environment (IDE), CodeLlama Completion would be the optimal choice. On the other hand, if your work involves complex algorithms and sophisticated code generation, CodeLlama WizardCoder offers superior performance, albeit at the cost of higher resource usage. Starcoder is excellent for those working with multiple programming languages, offering versatility and moderate resource requirements. Lastly, Cohere Command R is a well-rounded, general-purpose model suitable for environments where coding is one of many tasks.

Understanding these variations allows you to choose the model that best fits your development environment and workflow, ensuring you get the most out of your local LLM setup.
