# Selecting the Right Model

After understanding the benefits of running large language models (LLMs) locally, the next step is to effectively select and use the right model for your needs. These are the 4 steps you’ll need to do in inorder to add local LLM models into your workflow, ensuring you make the most of your hardware and achieve the best performance possible.

**Step 1: Understand Your Computer’s Capabilities**

The first step is to assess your computer's capabilities. The feasibility and performance of running models locally depend heavily on your hardware specifications, such as RAM, GPU, CPU, and storage. A system with 32GB of RAM and a powerful GPU, for instance, will handle more demanding models and deliver faster, more efficient performance than a less equipped setup. Understanding your hardware's strengths and limitations will guide you in choosing a model that fits your system’s capabilities.

**Step 2: Select the Right Model**

Once you understand your hardware, the next step is to select the appropriate model. These models come in various configurations that balance memory usage, computational resources, and speed. Your choice should be based on your specific needs—whether you need quick, iterative code completion, detailed instruction-based coding, or the ability to handle complex, resource-intensive tasks. Familiarizing yourself with the different model variations and their strengths will help you choose the most suitable option.

**Step 3: Decode the Naming Structure**

The naming structure of each model provides valuable insights into their configurations. For example, in the model name **CodeLlama-13b-Instruct.Q3_K_M.gguf**, each part denotes key attributes such as the model family, parameter size, variant type, quantization level, and optimization format. Understanding this structured naming helps you quickly identify a model’s capabilities and compatibility with your system specifications, making the selection process more straightforward.

**Step 4: Test the Model**

Before fully integrating a selected model into your workflow, it’s crucial to test it. Running standardized tests allows you to evaluate the model's response time, accuracy, and resource usage. This step ensures that the model meets your performance expectations and aligns well with your hardware capabilities. Testing helps you identify any potential issues and make necessary adjustments before deploying the model for regular use.

By following these four steps—understanding your computer's capabilities, selecting the right model, decoding the naming structure, and performing thorough testing—you can effectively integrate local LLMs into your development workflow. This structured approach enhances your coding efficiency and leverages the full potential of advanced AI models, ensuring you get the best possible performance from your setup.
