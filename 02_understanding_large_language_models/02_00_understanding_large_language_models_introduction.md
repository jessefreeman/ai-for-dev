# Understanding Large Language Models

This section provides a comprehensive understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs), covering their architecture, capabilities, and key concepts that developers need to know when working with these powerful AI systems locally.

## What You'll Learn

- How LLMs work and the transformer architecture that powers them
- Different model variations and their specific use cases
- Understanding parameter sizes and their impact on performance and resource requirements
- Model naming conventions and how to interpret them
- Quantization techniques for running models efficiently on consumer hardware
- How to scale models effectively for your specific needs

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, you should have:

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with your computer's hardware specifications (RAM, GPU, etc.)
- Some experience with software installation and configuration

## Getting Started

If you're new to LLMs, start with the [Overview of Large Language Models](02_01_overview_of_llms.md) to understand the fundamentals. For those looking to optimize performance, jump directly to [Parameter Size](02_04_parameter_size.md) and [Quantization](02_05_quantization.md).
