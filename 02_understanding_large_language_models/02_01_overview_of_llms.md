# Overview of Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, transforming how we interact with technology and manage complex tasks. When I joined Samsung in 2019 to do AI, LLMs like today’s version of ChatGPT were still science fiction. Fast forward to now and I can't imagine writing or coding without one.

At a high level, LLMs are sophisticated AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. Their ability to comprehend and produce text with a high degree of fluency and accuracy makes them powerful tools for a wide range of applications but can be especially beneficial as you’ll see later on in this guide.

## What Are LLMs?

LLMs are built using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging **transformer architecture**. Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that was introduced in 2017 and changed natural language processing. The key innovation of transformers is their use of "attention mechanisms" that allow the model to focus on different parts of the input text when generating each word, rather than processing text sequentially like older approaches.

Think of attention like highlighting the most important words in a sentence when you're trying to understand its meaning. For example, when processing "The cat sat on the mat," the transformer can simultaneously look at relationships between "cat" and "sat," "sat" and "mat," and so on, understanding that "cat" is the subject performing the action "sat." This parallel processing makes transformers much faster to train and more effective at understanding context than previous architectures.

These models are pre-trained on diverse and extensive datasets, which enables them to understand context, infer meaning, and generate coherent and contextually appropriate text based on given prompts. The level of interaction you can get out of these LLMs when using them for coding never ceases to impress me.

Here are some common types of LLMs:

| Model Type                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Use Cases                                                                                   |

| **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**                       | Developed by OpenAI, GPT models are designed to generate human-like text based on input prompts. They are known for their versatility and ability to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks.                                                                   | Content creation, conversational agents, text completion, and more.                         |
| **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** | Developed by Google, BERT models are designed to understand the context of words in a sentence by looking at both directions (left and right). This bidirectional approach helps in tasks that require understanding context, such as question answering and sentiment analysis. | Search engines, sentiment analysis, question answering systems, and more.                   |
| **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)**                           | Developed by Meta, LLaMA models are designed to be more efficient and accessible, providing high performance on language tasks with relatively fewer computational resources. They are suitable for both research and practical applications.                                    | Research in language modeling, practical applications in resource-constrained environments. |

## How Developers Can Use LLMs

### Workflow Integration Benefits

By integrating LLMs into your workflow, you can harness their power to build smarter, more efficient, and more responsive code. This not only improves the end-user experience but also accelerates development cycles when leveraged correctly. The key is treating them as powerful development partners rather than magical solutions.

Most of this guide was generated by an LLM and I cleaned it up to add my own perspective and verify what I'm learning is accurate since this is my first time focusing on running these models locally.
