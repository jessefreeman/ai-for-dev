# Advanced Usage

# Advanced Usage

This is where I share the more experimental stuff I've been working on. Fair warning: not everything here is practical for day-to-day development work. Some of it is just cool things I've figured out while tinkering.

## What's in This Section

After you've got the basics down and have been using local LLMs for a while, you might want to push things further. Here are some of the more advanced setups and experiments I've been working on:

**Custom Hardware Builds**: I've built dedicated machines for running LLMs and learned what actually matters for hardware
**Multi-Model Workflows**: Running different models for different tasks and chaining them together
**Development Integration**: Hooking LLMs directly into my IDE and build process
**Performance Tuning**: Squeezing every bit of performance out of models and hardware

## My Advanced Setup Evolution

**Stage 1**: Single model, basic prompting (where most people stop)
**Stage 2**: Multiple models for different tasks, saved prompt collections
**Stage 3**: Custom hardware, automated workflows, performance monitoring
**Stage 4**: Integration with development tools, custom fine-tuning experiments

Most of this stuff is overkill unless you're really into this or using LLMs heavily for work. But if you want to see what's possible, here are my notes:
| Custom Built PCs | Hardware specifications and builds for optimal LLM performance | Advanced |

## Prerequisites

Before exploring advanced usage, you should have:

- Successfully installed and used at least one local LLM platform
- Experience with model selection and basic optimization
- Understanding of your hardware capabilities and limitations
- Familiarity with development tools and workflows

## Who This Section Is For

- **Experienced Developers** looking to optimize their LLM workflows
- **DevOps Engineers** planning enterprise LLM deployments
- **Hardware Enthusiasts** building dedicated LLM systems
- **Teams** implementing local LLM strategies
- **Researchers** needing custom model configurations

## Getting Started

If you're comfortable with basic LLM usage, start with [Advanced Model Tuning](09_01_advanced_model_tuning.md). For those planning hardware upgrades or builds, jump to [Custom Built PCs](09_03_custom_built_pcs.md).
