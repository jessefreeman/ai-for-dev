# AI For Dev

Welcome to the AI For Dev guide! This comprehensive guide is designed to help developers set up and optimize local Large Language Models (LLMs) for coding assistance. Whether you're looking to leverage the power of AI to enhance your coding productivity or simply want to gain a deeper understanding of how these models work, this guide has you covered.

## About This Guide

### Purpose

I've been using ChatGPT and other AI models to assist with my coding projects for over a year now. Throughout this journey, I've encountered numerous benefits and challenges. This guide is a culmination of my experiences, insights, and best practices for running LLMs locally. It aims to provide developers with the knowledge and tools needed to harness the full potential of these powerful models on their own hardware.
