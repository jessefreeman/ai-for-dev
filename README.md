# AI For Dev `V0.2.2`

Welcome to the AI For Dev guide! This constantly evolving guide is designed to help developers set up and optimize local Large Language Models (LLMs) for help with coding. Whether you're looking to leverage the power of AI to enhance your productivity, are still learning how to code, or want to gain a deeper understanding of how these models work, this guide is a collection of findings, experiments, and observations to help you in your journey.

You can explore the **GitBook** version of this guide at [aifor.dev][1] or use this [Table of Contents][2] to explore the guide's markdown on **GitHub**.

## How to Contribute

I invite anyone who's LLMs online or locally to help with coding to contribute and help grow and improve this guide. Whether you have new model test results, best practices, or other valuable insights, your contributions can help others as we figure out how to leverage AI in our development workflows. Please refer to the [contribution guidelines][3] for detailed instructions on how to contribute.
