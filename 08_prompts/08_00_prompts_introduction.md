# Prompts

Master the art of prompt engineering for coding tasks. This section provides a curated collection of effective prompts, examples, and techniques for getting the best results from your local LLMs when working on development projects.

## What You'll Learn

- Effective prompt structures for different coding tasks
- How to communicate clearly with LLMs to get precise results
- Advanced prompting techniques for complex scenarios
- Model-specific prompt optimization strategies
- Troubleshooting common prompting issues

## Prompt Categories

### Code Generation

- **Function Creation**: Prompts for generating specific functions
- **Class Design**: Creating complete classes with methods and properties
- **API Integration**: Connecting to external services and APIs
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Complex algorithmic solutions

### Code Analysis

- **Code Review**: Getting feedback on existing code
- **Bug Detection**: Finding and fixing issues in code
- **Performance Analysis**: Identifying optimization opportunities
- **Security Review**: Spotting potential security vulnerabilities

### Documentation & Learning

- **Code Explanation**: Understanding complex code sections
- **Documentation Generation**: Creating comments and documentation
- **Learning New Technologies**: Exploring unfamiliar frameworks
- **Best Practices**: Getting advice on coding standards

### Workflow Automation

- **Testing**: Generating unit tests and test cases
- **Refactoring**: Improving code structure and readability
- **Configuration**: Setting up build tools and environments
- **Deployment**: Creating deployment scripts and configurations

## Prompt Engineering Principles

### 1. **Be Specific and Clear**

- Provide context about your project and requirements
- Specify the programming language and framework
- Include examples of desired output format

### 2. **Use Structured Prompts**

- Break complex requests into smaller, manageable parts
- Use consistent formatting for similar tasks
- Include relevant code snippets for context

### 3. **Iterate and Refine**

- Start with simple prompts and add complexity gradually
- Test prompts with different models to find what works best
- Keep a collection of proven prompts for reuse

## Model-Specific Considerations

Different models respond better to different prompting styles:

- **Code Llama**: Prefers detailed technical specifications
- **Mistral**: Works well with structured, step-by-step instructions
- **Smaller Models**: Benefit from simpler, more direct prompts
- **Larger Models**: Can handle complex, multi-part requests

## Getting the Most From Your Prompts

- **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
- **Set Constraints**: Specify limitations, preferences, and requirements
- **Ask for Explanations**: Request reasoning behind suggestions
- **Request Alternatives**: Ask for multiple approaches to problems
