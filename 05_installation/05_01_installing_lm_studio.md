# Installing LM Studio

**LM Studio** is a free, more user-friendly tool designed for developers and data scientists to run LLMs locally on their machines. It provides a clean interface and the ability to facilitate the deployment and testing of LLMs without needing extensive cloud resources or messing with the command line, setting up services, and connecting to API endpoints. To get started with LM Studio, download it from the official [LM Studio website](https://lmstudio.ai/).

Select the version compatible with your computer and download the installer. After the installation is complete, you’ll be ready to launch the app. The first time you open LM Studio, you may need to grant permission for it to run. Follow any on-screen prompts to complete this step.

Upon launching LM Studio for the first time, you will be guided through an initial setup process. During this setup, you can set your preferences, such as default language model settings and workspace configurations. LM Studio may also prompt you to configure the environment, including paths to necessary dependencies or model directories. You can always go back and customize this later on in the app’s settings.

Once the initial setup is complete, take some time to explore the LM Studio interface. The interface is organized into key sections, including the model management area, settings menu, and workspace. In the model management area, you will add, configure, and manage the LLMs you plan to run.

Here, you can easily import models and adjust their settings to optimize performance. The settings menu provides access to various options that allow you to customize your experience and optimize performance based on your hardware capabilities. The workspace is the main area where you will input commands, test models, and view outputs.
